    1.ZeroTier Port Forwarding
    2.client auto connect, discover other nodes
    3.Txp multithread
    4.Txp Ack Bug, does not support more than 3 nodes, some times crashes at 3.
        -My personal speculation is that based on how client respond, sometimes a response packet CAN take the place of a ACK packet
    5.Better SMT generation
    

    *Does client require hard coded IP addresses to connect to?
        -Can we make auto server connection?
    *How ZeroTier work?
        -Asked Mathew to look into it.
        -Port forwarding,
        -cloud server
    
    Discussion of project goals regarding Project brief.
    i) discovering other nodes
    ii) negotiate with other nodes
        -see their capabilities, services and constraints
    iii) reaching consensus
        -shared agreement -> z3 result
    iv) Action: Meaningful and effective use of consensus
        -Problem solving
            -> Math problems.

    code + report submit by week 12.
